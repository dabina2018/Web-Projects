<p>I taught English in japan for two years and I had a blast. I started a short blog to keep up with my japanese and also make connections with new pen pals, check out my site <a href="https://easy-english-4u.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>While living in Japan, I made friends with the daughter of a local dojo owner. We became good friends and I even took on some of her pupils as English students. I made a small site to promote the dojo as well as tournaments the students were participating in. Check it out <a href="https://shokenjukusagamiharadojo.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>
